Description: Tools to run system processes in the background.
    It can check if a background process is running; wait on a background
    process to finish; get the exit status of finished processes; kill
    background processes. It can read the standard output and error of
    the processes, using non-blocking connections. 'processx' can poll
    a process for standard output or error, with a timeout. It can also
    poll several processes at once.
